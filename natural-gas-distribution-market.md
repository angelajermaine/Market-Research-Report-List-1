<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Distribution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)</li><li>Pipeline Natural Gas (PNG)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas distribution market consists of two main types: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Pipeline Natural Gas (PNG). CNG involves compressing natural gas to reduce its volume and make it feasible for transportation via trucks or vehicles. It is commonly used as a fuel for automobiles or in isolated areas. On the other hand, PNG is distributed through a network of pipelines directly to consumers' homes, industries, or businesses. PNG is a more convenient and widely used option compared to CNG, allowing for a continuous and reliable supply of natural gas.</p></p>

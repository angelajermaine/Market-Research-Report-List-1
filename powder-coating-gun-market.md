<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder Coating Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corona Powder Coating Gun</li><li>Tribo Powder Coating Gun</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The powder coating gun market consists of two main types: the Corona powder coating gun and the Tribo powder coating gun. The Corona powder coating gun utilizes an electrostatic charging process where the powder particles are negatively charged and attracted to the positively charged workpiece. On the other hand, the Tribo powder coating gun employs friction to create a positive charge on the powder particles, which are then attracted to the negatively charged workpiece. Both types offer effective powder coating solutions, but they differ in their charging methods.</p></p>

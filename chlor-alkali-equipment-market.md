<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlor-alkali Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion Exchange Membrane Method</li><li>Diaphragm Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chlor-alkali equipment market consists of two major types: the ion exchange membrane method and the diaphragm method. In the ion exchange membrane method, a selectively permeable membrane is used to separate the chlorine and caustic soda produced during electrolysis. This method is more energy-efficient and has a higher purity of products. On the other hand, the diaphragm method uses a porous diaphragm that allows for the separation of chlorine and caustic soda. Although this method is less energy-efficient, it is still widely used due to its lower cost.</p></p>

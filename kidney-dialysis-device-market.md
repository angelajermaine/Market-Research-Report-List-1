<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney Dialysis Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis (HD)</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Kidney Dialysis Device market encompasses two main types of treatment: Hemodialysis (HD) and Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis involves filtering the blood by passing it through an artificial kidney machine, while Peritoneal Dialysis uses the body's peritoneum membrane as a natural filter. HD is the more common form of dialysis, involving regular visits to a healthcare facility, whereas PD can be performed at home. Both types of dialysis help to remove waste and excess fluid from the body when the natural kidney function is impaired or lost.</p></p>

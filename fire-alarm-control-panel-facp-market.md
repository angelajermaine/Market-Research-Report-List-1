<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional</li><li>Addressable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP) market can be categorized into two types: Conventional and Addressable. Conventional systems divide a building into zones, with multiple detectors connected to a single zone. When the alarm is triggered, the zone is identified, but the precise location of the fire is not indicated. Addressable systems, on the other hand, assign a unique address to each detector, allowing for individual identification. This enables a more accurate pinpointing of the fire's location. Both types have their advantages and are tailored to specific needs and budget considerations.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracolumbar Vertebral Corpectomy Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Expandable</li><li>Non-expandable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thoracolumbar vertebral corpectomy prostheses are devices used in spinal fusion surgeries to replace a damaged or diseased vertebra. The market for these prostheses is classified into two types: expandable and non-expandable. Expandable prostheses can be adjusted in size during surgery to ensure a perfect fit and provide stability to the spinal column. Non-expandable prostheses, on the other hand, come in fixed sizes and cannot be adjusted. Both types aim to restore stability and function to the spine, albeit through different mechanisms.</p></p>

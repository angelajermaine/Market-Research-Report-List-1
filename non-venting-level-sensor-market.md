<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Venting Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Type Liquid Level Sensor</li><li>Hydrostatic Liquid Level Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Non-Venting Level Sensor market includes two types of sensors: Float Type Liquid Level Sensor and Hydrostatic Liquid Level Sensor. </p><p>Float Type Liquid Level Sensor measures the liquid level by floating on the surface. As the liquid level changes, the float moves up or down, providing the corresponding measurement. </p><p>On the other hand, the Hydrostatic Liquid Level Sensor measures the pressure exerted by the liquid column to determine the liquid level. It uses a pressure-sensitive element that converts the pressure into an electrical signal, indicating the level of the liquid. Both types are commonly used in various industrial applications for accurate liquid level measurement.</p></p>

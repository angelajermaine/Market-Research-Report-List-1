<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zonal Isolation Packers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Packers</li><li>Retrievable Packers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zonal isolation packers are used in the oil and gas industry to create a barrier between different zones in a wellbore. Permanent packers are designed to remain in place for the entire life of the well, providing a permanent isolation solution. On the other hand, retrievable packers can be easily removed from the wellbore, allowing for re-entry and re-use. Both types of packers serve the purpose of isolating zones, but permanent packers offer a long-term solution while retrievable packers offer more flexibility for future operations.</p></p>

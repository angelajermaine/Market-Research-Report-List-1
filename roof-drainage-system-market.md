<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roof Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Drainage System</li><li>Siphonic Drainage System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Roof drainage systems are designed to efficiently redirect rainwater away from the roof surface and prevent damage to the building structure. Two common types of roof drainage systems are gravity drainage and siphonic drainage. </p><p>Gravity drainage systems rely on the force of gravity to direct water through downspouts and pipes to a lower location or drainage point. </p><p>On the other hand, siphonic drainage systems use a vacuum effect to rapidly remove water from the roof through a series of pipes. This system allows for larger volumes of water to be drained quickly, making it suitable for buildings with large roof areas.</p></p>

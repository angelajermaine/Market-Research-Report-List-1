<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Troponin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Troponin I (TnI)</li><li>Troponin T (TnT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Troponin market consists of two main types: Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT). Troponin I is a type of protein found in heart muscle cells and is released into the bloodstream when there is damage to these cells. It is considered a highly sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing heart attacks. On the other hand, Troponin T is also a protein found in heart muscle cells, but it has a slightly different molecular structure compared to TnI. Nevertheless, it serves a similar purpose and is used as a biomarker for detecting heart muscle damage.</p></p>

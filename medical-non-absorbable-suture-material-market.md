<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Non-absorbable Suture Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Material</li><li>Natural Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical non-absorbable suture material market is classified into two types: synthetic material and natural material. Synthetic material refers to sutures made from man-made substances such as nylon, polyester, and polypropylene. These sutures are durable, resist degradation, and provide good tensile strength. On the other hand, natural material sutures are made from biological sources like silk or catgut. These sutures are generally absorbable but can also be processed to be non-absorbable, providing flexibility and ease of handling. Both types of sutures are widely used in surgical procedures for wound closure and tissue approximation.</p></p>

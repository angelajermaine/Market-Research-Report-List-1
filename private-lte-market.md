<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Private LTE Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FDD</li><li>TDD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Private LTE refers to a local wireless network using LTE technology that is dedicated and operated by an organization for its own needs. There are two types of Private LTE market types, namely Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD). FDD operates by dedicating separate frequency bands for uplink and downlink communications, allowing simultaneous two-way data transmission. TDD, on the other hand, shares the same frequency band for both uplink and downlink communications, but splits them into different time slots, enabling alternating two-way data transmission.</p></p>

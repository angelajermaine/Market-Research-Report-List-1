<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Exhaust Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial exhaust fans are essential for maintaining indoor air quality and removing stale or contaminated air in various commercial settings like restaurants, factories, and offices. There are two main types of commercial exhaust fans: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans use rotating impellers to create a high-pressure air flow perpendicular to the fan axis, making them suitable for ventilation systems with high static pressure. On the other hand, axial fans draw air parallel to the fan axis and are ideal for applications with low static pressure and high airflow requirements, such as cooling or venting large spaces.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrauterine Contraceptive Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hormonal IUCD</li><li>Copper IUCD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) market consists of two main types: hormonal IUCDs and copper IUCDs. Hormonal IUCDs release low amounts of hormones, such as progestin, which thicken the cervical mucus and prevent fertilization. These devices also inhibit the uterine lining growth, resulting in lighter periods. Copper IUCDs, on the other hand, do not contain hormones. Instead, they release copper ions, which create a toxic environment for sperm, thus preventing fertilization. Both types of IUCDs are widely used and offer effective long-term contraceptive solutions for women.</p></p>

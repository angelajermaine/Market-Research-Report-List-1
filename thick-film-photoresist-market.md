<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thick film photoresist market comprises positive photoresists and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists are light-sensitive materials that become soluble in a developer when exposed to UV light. They are used to create desired patterns by exposing the resist to light through a photomask. On the other hand, negative photoresists become insoluble upon UV light exposure, and the exposed areas can be washed away by a developer solution. Both types of photoresists find applications in various industries such as electronics, display devices, and microfabrication.</p></p>

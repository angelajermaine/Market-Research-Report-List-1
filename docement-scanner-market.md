<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Docement Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD</li><li>CIS</li><li>CMOS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The document scanner market is divided into three types: CCD (charge-coupled device), CIS (contact image sensor), and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor). CCD scanners use a series of mirrors and lenses to capture an image, providing high-quality scans suitable for professional use. CIS scanners, on the other hand, use an array of sensors to capture images directly, making them more compact and energy-efficient for home or small office applications. CMOS scanners use a similar technology to CIS but offer faster scanning speeds, making them suitable for high-volume scanning needs.</p></p>

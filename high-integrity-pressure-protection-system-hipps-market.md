<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Field Initiator</li><li>Logic Solver</li><li>Valve</li><li>Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High-Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) market is segmented into four main types: Field Initiator, Logic Solver, Valve, and Actuator. Field Initiators are sensors that detect pressure levels and initiate the HIPPS to act. Logic Solvers are the brain of the system, analyzing data from Field Initiators and deciding when to activate the Valve. Valves are crucial components that shut off the flow of fluids when dangerously high pressure is detected. Actuators physically close the Valve in response to signals from the Logic Solver.</p></p>

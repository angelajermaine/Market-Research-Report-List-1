<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micellar Casein Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Micellar Casein Isolates</li><li>Micellar Casein Concentrate</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Micellar casein is a type of protein that is derived from milk. There are two main types of micellar casein in the market â€“ micellar casein isolates and micellar casein concentrate. Micellar casein isolates are processed to remove most of the lactose and fat, resulting in a protein powder that is up to 90% protein content. On the other hand, micellar casein concentrate contains a lower protein content of around 80%, as it undergoes less processing. Both types of micellar casein are commonly used in the fitness and sports nutrition industry for their slow digestion and sustained release of amino acids.</p></p>

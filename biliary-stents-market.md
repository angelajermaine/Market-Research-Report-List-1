<p><h1>Biliary Stents Market Size Reflecting a Forecast Till 2031: Market By Type, By Application and By Geography</h1></p><p><strong>Biliary Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Biliary stents are small tubes that are inserted into the bile duct to treat various biliary disorders. These disorders include bile duct stones, biliary strictures, obstructive jaundice, and cholangiocarcinoma. Biliary stents are also used to facilitate the drainage of bile in patients with liver transplantation and to prevent complications after surgery.</p><p>The global market for biliary stents is projected to experience significant growth in the coming years. Factors contributing to this growth include a rising geriatric population prone to biliary disorders, increasing prevalence of gallstones and biliary strictures, and advancements in stent technology. Furthermore, the growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures and the rising number of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures are also fueling market growth.</p><p>In terms of market trends, there is a shift towards the use of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) due to their superior performance and longevity. SEMS provide better patency, reduced migration rates, and decreased need for repeat interventions compared to plastic stents. This has led to an increased demand for SEMS in biliary stenting procedures.</p><p>Additionally, there is a growing focus on the development of bioabsorbable biliary stents. These stents are designed to dissolve over time, eliminating the need for additional invasive procedures for stent removal. The use of bioabsorbable materials in biliary stents offers benefits such as reduced risk of stent migration, improved patient comfort, and decreased healthcare costs.</p><p>Overall, the biliary stents market is expected to witness steady growth during the forecast period, driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of biliary disorders and advancements in stent technology. The market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% during this period.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Biliary Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Stents</li><li>Plastic Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biliary stents are medical devices used to treat obstructions or narrowings in the bile ducts. There are two main types: metal stents and plastic stents. Metal stents are made of stainless steel or nitinol, providing excellent structural support and flexibility. They are durable and commonly used in cases of long-term stenting. On the other hand, plastic stents are softer and easily removable. They are typically used for short-term stenting or as a temporary measure before other interventions. Both types of stents help restore bile flow, alleviate symptoms, and improve the overall quality of life for patients.</p></p>
